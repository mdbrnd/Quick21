# Frontend - Quick21 - Blackjack Game

## Overview
This is the frontend for the Quick21 Blackjack game. It is built with React + TS + socket.io (client) and uses Tailwind CSS for styling. No important logic is computed here to make it secure.

### Available Scripts
Since the server serves the build instead of connecting to a separate client instance, running this by itself would not be of much use.

## Project Structure

- `src/`: Contains the source code for the React application.
- `public/`: Contains the public assets (card images, icon, etc.) and the HTML template.
